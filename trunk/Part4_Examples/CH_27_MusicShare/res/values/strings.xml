Sharing Music is an application for sharing any music file between two separate devices, which is easy to use.  Android Beam will be in operation when you attach the back of your device to that of another for a couple of seconds. Then, please touch the screen which becomes smaller, when you see the word SHARING. This makes the two devices connected through Bluetooth. After the two devices are connected, you should choose any music you want to send, click it, and then press the button for sharing music. Now, the music will be transmitted to the other device. 
Please remember that an unstable Bluetooth connection can make the music transmission stopped all of sudden before Sharing Music completing the work.
